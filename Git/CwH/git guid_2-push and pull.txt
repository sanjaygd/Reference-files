-->
this always means that you didn't synchronize the remote repository with local repo,so first you should synchronize them by using command git pull as following:

git checkout master    
git pull origin master 

after this process ,you will synchronize them ,and then you can push changes to remote repo by followings:

git add [filename/directory]  
git commit -m"input your message"   
git remote add origin https://github.com//yourname.git     
git push origin master
