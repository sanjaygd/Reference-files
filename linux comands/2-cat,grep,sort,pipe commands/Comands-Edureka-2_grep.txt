2.grep -i option file.txt - returns the result for case insensitive strings.

3.grep -n option file.txt - returns the matching string along with their line number.

4.grep -v option file.txt - returns results of lines which are not matching the search string.

5.grep -c option file.txt - returns the number of lines in which the result match search strinng.
