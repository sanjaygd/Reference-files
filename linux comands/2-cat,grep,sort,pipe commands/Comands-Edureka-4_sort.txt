*** Working with sort command ***

We use the 'sort' command to sort the result of search eitther alphabetically or numerically. Files, file contents and directories can be sorted.

1.sort file.txt -Sorts the content of the file.txt and returns them in alphabetical order

2.sort file1.txt file2.txt -Sort the content of both the files.

3.sort -f file.txt - 'f' flag does case insensitive sorting.

4. sort -n file.txt - 'n' flag returns the results as per numerical order.
